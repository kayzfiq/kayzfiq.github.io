## Hi, I'm Kaye Shafiq

I'm a Cybersecurity enthusiast on a mission to transition from network engineering to blue team security operations. Based in Kampala, Uganda, I'm building the technical foundation needed to defend systems and networks against real-world threats.

## My Journey
My path into cybersecurity started with networking. After earning my CCNA certification, I gained a solid understanding of how data flows, how networks are structured, and—crucially—where vulnerabilities exist. But I realized that to truly protect systems, I needed to understand them at a deeper level.

That led me to Linux system administration. I earned my LPIC-1 certification and discovered that I love the challenge of building, securing, and automating infrastructure. Now, I'm combining these skills as I work toward my ultimate goal: **becoming a cybersecurity engineer specializing in defensive security**.

## My Technical Stack
##Operating Systems:

* Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) - Daily driver and specialty
* Comfortable with RHEL-based systems

### Networking:

* CCNA-certified understanding of TCP/IP, routing, switching, and network security
* Firewall configuration (UFW, iptables)
* Network troubleshooting and diagnostics

### System Administration:

* Bash scripting and automation
* Configuration management (Ansible)
* Monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Grafana, rsyslog)

### Security:

* System hardening (CIS benchmarks)
* SSH security and access control
* Security logging and audit trails
* Intrusion detection concepts
* Currently learning: SIEM tools, threat intelligence, incident response

### Tools & Technologies:

* Git/GitHub for version control
* Docker basics
* Hugo for static sites
* Markdown for documentation

### Certifications
* CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)
* LPIC-1 (Linux Professional Institute Certification Level 1)
* Certified in Cybersecurity by ISC2

### In Progress:

* CompTIA Security+
* Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)

### Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with:

* Fellow cybersecurity learners
* System administrators transitioning to security
* Blue team professionals willing to share insights
* Anyone passionate about defensive security

### Open to Opportunities

I'm actively seeking roles in:

* Linux System Administration (current focus)
* Junior Security Analyst positions
* SOC Analyst roles
* DevSecOps positions
* Infrastructure Security

### A Note on My Approach

I believe cybersecurity is a continuous journey, not a destination. Every system I secure, every script I write, and every article I publish is a step toward becoming the security professional I aspire to be.

I'm not claiming to be an expert—I'm documenting my path to expertise. If you're on a similar journey, I hope my experiences help you avoid some of the pitfalls I've encountered and accelerate your own learning.

**The best time to start learning was yesterday. The second best time is now**.

Let's build more secure systems together. 🛡️
